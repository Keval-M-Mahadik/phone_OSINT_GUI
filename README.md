# Phone_OSINT_GUI

A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool for performing OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigations on phone numbers — built in Python.

# 🧠 What it does

Allows you to input a phone number and then uses OSINT techniques to gather publicly-available information.

Presents results in a user-friendly GUI rather than command line.

Intended to help threat-analysts, security researchers or curious users investigate phone numbers in a structured manner.

Built with ease-of-use in mind — minimal setup, straight to the GUI.

# ✅ Why use it

Speeds up the initial investigation process for phone numbers.

GUI makes it accessible even to users less comfortable with CLI tools.

Open-source: you can review the code, modify it for your own workflows.

Under GPL-3.0 licence, so you can freely use, adapt and extend it (with compliance).

# 🛠 Features

Single-window interface: enter phone number → initiate scan → view summary of findings.

Modular architecture (potentially) so you can plug in additional OSINT modules.

Cross-platform (since built in Python).

Before using: check applicable laws & ethics in your jurisdiction for phone number lookup / OSINT investigations.

# 🚀 Getting started

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Keval-M-Mahadik/phone_OSINT_GUI.git

Launch the GUI (e.g., python main.py).

Enter a phone number and run the tool.

Review results, export or act on them as needed.

# ⚠️ Important/legal disclaimer
